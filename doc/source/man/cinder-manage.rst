SYNOPSIS
========

  cinder-manage <category> <action> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

:command:`cinder-manage` provides control of cinder database migration,
and provides an interface to get information about the current state
of cinder.
More information about OpenStack Cinder is available at `OpenStack Cinder <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/>`_.

OPTIONS
=======

The standard pattern for executing a cinder-manage command is:
``cinder-manage <category> <command> [<args>]``

For example, to obtain a list of the cinder services currently running:
``cinder-manage service list``

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories:
``cinder-manage``

Categories are shell, logs, migrate, db, volume, host, service, backup, version, and config. Detailed descriptions are below.

You can also run with a category argument such as 'db' to see a list of all commands in that category:
``cinder-manage db``

These sections describe the available categories and arguments for cinder-manage.

Cinder Db
~~~~~~~~~

``cinder-manage db version``

    Print the current database version.

``cinder-manage db sync``

``cinder-manage db purge [<number of days>]``

    Purge database entries that are marked as deleted, that are older than the number of days specified.

``cinder-manage db online_data_migrations``

    Perform online data migrations for database upgrade between releases in batches.

    This command interprets the following options when it is invoked:

    --max_count     Maximum number of objects to consider.
    --ignore_state  Force records to migrate even if another operation is
                    performed on them. This may be dangerous, please refer to
