====================
Cinder Sample Policy
====================

The following is a sample Cinder policy file that has been auto-generated
from default policy values in code. If you're using the default policies, then
the maintenance of this file is not necessary.
It is here to help explain which policy operations protect specific Cinder API,
but it is not suggested to copy and paste into a deployment unless you're planning
on providing a different policy for an operation that is not the default. For
instance, if you want to change the default value of "volume:create", you only
need to keep this single rule in your policy config
file (**/etc/cinder/policy.json**).

The sample policy file can also be viewed in `file form <_static/cinder.policy.yaml.sample>`_.
