      requires storage in multiples of 8GB. There is a known limitation such
      that a request to extend the size of a volume for these backends will be
      rounded up to the nearest multiple but the actual physical size of the
      storage will not be reflected back in the API for the volume size. For
      example, a request to extend the size of an 8GB ScaleIO-backed volume
      to 9GB will actually result in 16GB of physical storage but only 9GB will
      be reflected in the API and counted for quota usage.
